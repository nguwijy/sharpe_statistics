## Sharpe statistics
This is the python replication of the paper [Robust performance hypothesis testing with the Sharpe ratio](http://www.ledoit.net/jef_2008pdf.pdf).
Some of the codes are also inspired by the PR created [here](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens/pull/384).
Only HAC inference and the bootstrap method have been implemented.
